      "explanations": {
        "a": "Joule's effect refers to heat produced by current, not emf generation.",
        "b": "Peltier effect is the reverse of Seebeck, related to heat absorption/release.",
        "c": "Seebeck effect is the correct term for emf generation due to temperature difference.",
