## Assignment

<ol>
  <li>
    Calculate the value of hot EMF when a Platinum-Rhodium thermocouple is used. Adjust the hot temperature to 231°C and the reference temperature to 0°C.
  </li>

  <li>
    Draw a graph connecting thermo EMF and temperature difference between the two junctions when a Platinum-Rhodium thermocouple is used. Adjust the hot temperature to 884°C and the reference temperature to 40°C.
  </li>

  <li>
    By drawing the graph, find the relation between thermo EMF and temperature of the hot junction for: <br>
    a) Iron-Constantan thermocouple <br>
    b) Copper-Constantan thermocouple <br>
    when the hot junction is at 300°C and the reference junction at 80°C.
  </li>

  <li>
    Calculate the value of hot EMF when a Chromel-Alumel thermocouple is used. Adjust the hot temperature to 100°C and the reference temperature to 250°C.
  </li>

  <li>
    Draw a graph connecting thermo EMF and temperature difference between the two junctions when a Chromel-Constantan thermocouple is used. Adjust the hot temperature to 500°C and the reference temperature to 100°C.
