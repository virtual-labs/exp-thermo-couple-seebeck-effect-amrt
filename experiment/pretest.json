      "question": "The law which explains the heat produced in a conductor when an electric current flows through it is",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Ohm's law",
        "b": "Faraday's law",
        "c": "Joule's law",
        "d": "Lenz's law"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Ohm's law relates voltage, current, and resistance but does not describe heat production.",
        "b": "Faraday's law relates to electromagnetic induction.",
        "c": "Joule's law explains heat produced in a conductor due to electric current.",
        "d": "Lenz's law deals with the direction of induced emf."

        "a": "IV",
        "b": "I²R",
        "c": "V²/R",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "P = IV is one form of power expression.",
        "b": "P = I²R is also valid when resistance and current are known.",
        "c": "P = V²/R is another valid form when voltage and resistance are known.",
        "d": "All options are correct expressions of power depending on known quantities."
